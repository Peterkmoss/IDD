The consistency model used in the CAP theorem revolves around having the same data on all
replicas of the distributed system, where as in ACID consistency is to not have different things
happening due to simultaious transactions or that some integrity constraints are no longer satisfied.
ACID is using locks and logs to prevent inconsistency from appearing within the system, 
as well as constraints and triggers. 
Consistency in CAP is maintaining consistency by replicating data to more nodes, 
so if one of them crashes / goes offline the data is still there.
